The green nodes represent people, and the pink nodes represent the documents. The layout seems more of a circular broccoli tree. Go to Data Laboratory, and then go back to Overview. Now, you should be able to click any node, pick Select in data laboratory, and view your selected node once you go to Data Laboratory.
