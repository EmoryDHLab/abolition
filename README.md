# Vectors of Freedom
Welcome to the main repository for the Vectors of Freedom project. 

Here you can find the code associated with our various investigations into the abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States.

For some background on the project, click [here](https://dhlab.lmc.gatech.edu/tome/vectors-of-freedom/). 

We will update this README with more information as we prepare aspects of the project for publication.
